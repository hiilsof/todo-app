Basic To do List Application with React

Try it yourself!
https://hiilsof.github.io/todo-app/

it may take a while...
if it doesnt load refresh the page

I wanted to start with something simple
Though at the moment it is still pretty bare bones

so far it is able to store todos persistently 
so that when you refresh it the todos do not dissappear

source code in master branch

using:
HTML
Javascript
uuidv4
git

I'll add CSS to make it look better :)
